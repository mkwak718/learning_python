Learning Python
These learning materials are designed to support introductory programming courses at Middle Georgia State University, but they can also provide introductions to these topics for anyone interested. All are works in progress and are being expanded as time permits. They have been tested using the latest versions of Python.

The development of these materials was supported by a new University System of Georgia initiative, Affordable Learning Georgia (ALG), which focuses on reducing the costs of textbooks and the enhancement of GALILEO, Georgia’s Virtual Library and ALG’s parent initiative.
